YouTube Video Caption/Subtitle Downloader

I enjoy watching captioned talks, but sometimes i'm busy doing something else or the network bandwidth is low so i had to download the videos and watch them later. The problem is YouTube doesn't allow downloading videos captions unless you're the owner of the channel and here where this script comes handy. You can download captions in it's SubRip Text format (srt), add it to your favourite video player and enjoy the show!
